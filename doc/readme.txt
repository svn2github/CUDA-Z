This small document may answer some of your questions about what you need
for using and building CUDA-Z.

What is CUDA-Z?
---------------

CUDA-Z is a small simple utility showing information about CUDA devices
installed in your PC/notebook or whatever you call computer.

What is CUDA?
-------------

CUDA is a NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture. You can get more
information about it from page CUDA ZONE at NVIDIA's website
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html

What is CUDA-device?
--------------------

It is simple... It is a device that supports CUDA. NVIDIA call it 
"CUDA-enabled products ".

What I need for running CUDA-Z utility?
---------------------------------------

You need CUDA-device and CUDA driver for your OS.
Dowload CUDA-Z binary package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cuda-z/ ,
upack it and run cuda-z.exe. Have fun!

What I need for building CUDA-Z from sources?
---------------------------------------------

In Windows you need:
1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (not 2008!). Having Express edition is enough.
   Unfortunatly you can't use it with MinGW32 of Cygwin because NVIDIA doesn't
   support this compilers in Windows environment.
   Install also last Windows Platform SDK.
   http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/
2. Qt 4.4 (OpenSource) or close to it. You should build Qt with
   Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (Qt built with MinGW will not be linked with
   code generated by MS Visual C++).

3. CUDA driver and CUDA toolkit installed on your computer.

Now you have enough tools for building CUDA-Z. I would recommend you to add
all binaries diretories to global PATH variable or to vsvars32.bat that lives
in your "X:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools\" .
Now open Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt, go to folder where you place source
of CUDA-Z and type:
   > qmake
   > nmake
If no error occures you will found cuda-z.exe in bin folder.

I didn't try to build CUDA-Z in Linux and MacOS X, but it should be even
easier comparing to Windows. You can get gcc and g++ from your OS destibuter
(XCode tools in case of MacOS X). You still have to download or build Qt and
CUDA driver and tools packages from NVIDIA website. Have fun! :-)
Give me your feedback will it work out?
